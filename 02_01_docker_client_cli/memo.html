<!-- running container command -->
docker run [image-name]

<!-- command override -->
1. image has default command which run after creating container
2. you can override default command by using command below
docker run [image-name] [command to override]

<!-- command override sample command -->
docker run busybox echo hi there

<!-- FileSystem Snapshot sample from image -->
<!-- You can see busybox image has FileSystem Snapshot like bin, dev, etc. -->
docker run busybox ls

<!-- why use busybox? -->
because busybox has ls command.
on the other hand, hello-world image doesn't has such command, 
lead to error if you execute command below.

docker run hello-world ls
docker run hello-world echo hi there

<!-- docker ps -->
for listing all running containers

docker ps

<!-- for check docker ps -->
docker run busybox ping google.com

<!-- check all container created -->
docker ps --all

<!-- container lifecycle -->
1. docker run = docker create + docker start

<!-- docker create sample -->
docker create hello-world

<!-- docker start sample -->
<!-- -a is for printout output from container to terminal -->
docker start -a [container id]

<!-- restart container -->
<!-- restart can re-execute with default command, no override -->
docker start [container id]

<!-- delete all stopped container -->
docker system prune

<!-- get log from container -->
docker create busybox echo hi there
docker start [container id]
docker logs [container id]

<!-- stop container -->
docker create busybox ping google.com
docker start [container id]
docker stop [container id]
<!-- or -->
docker kill [container id]

<!-- difference of stop and kill -->
stop is always recommended.
stop gives some time to clean up or waiting for finish process.
kill order just stop, without waiting.

<!-- multi command container -->
<!-- execute another command inside a container -->
docker run redis
docker exec -it [container id] [command]
docker exec -it [container id] redis-cli
set myvalue 5
get myvalue

<!-- what is -it? -->
-i is for connect terminal to STDIN 
-t is for formatting output in terminal (technically they do more than that though)

<!-- get command prompt inside a container -->
<!-- you can get full-control of commands in unix environment -->
docker run redis
docker exec -it [contaienr id] sh
cd /
ls
redis-cli
cttl + c

<!-- stop, kill, exit from sh, shell -->
cntl + d

<!-- what is sh? -->
most common command prompt inside a container
other command prompt is below
1. bash - mac
2. power shell - windows
3. zsh
4. sh - linux, most popular
