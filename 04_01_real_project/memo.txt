// node app with docker steps
1. create node js web app 
2. create a docker file 
3. build image from dockerfile 
4. run image as container 
5. connect to web app from a browser

// alpine is super simple
only basic linux commands only.
no npm.

// how to solve no npm?
there are 2 approaches.
1. use a different base image which already has npm, node.
2. install npm, node by RUN command in dockerfile.

// alpine tag means smallest, simplest image.

// open port
docker run -p [local port] : [container port] [image id / name]
docker run -p 8080:8080 hiranokuosaka/simpleweb

// open sh in node container
docker run -it hiranokuosaka/simpleweb sh

// set workdir
this is important to prevent delete existing default folders.
command for Dockerfile is below.

WORKDIR /usr/app

// avoid unnecessary re-build
general rule is, make copy command as small as possible
so that docker-server can use cache.
